        <h2>Steps to Perform Ghusl</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by making the intention (niyyah) for Ghusl. Ensure that you are in a state of cleanliness before starting.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Wash both hands thoroughly up to the wrists three times.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Perform wudu (ablution) as you normally would, including washing the mouth, nose, face, arms, and wiping the head.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wash your private parts thoroughly to ensure they are clean.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Begin by pouring water over your head and ensure that it reaches the scalp. Repeat this process three times, ensuring the water reaches every strand of hair and skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Wash the entire body, starting from the right side, and then wash the left side. Be thorough, making sure that no part of the body is left dry, including under the arms, behind the ears, and between the toes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Ensure that the water has flowed over every part of your body and that you are fully cleansed.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 8:</strong> After Ghusl, perform a prayer or make a dua as a means of expressing gratitude for the purification.</li>
        </ul>
